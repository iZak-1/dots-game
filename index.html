<!--
v1.0: initial publish
v1.0.1: the website now works
v1.0.2: the website now includes the canvas, instead of being blank
v1.1: the canvas changes to fit the screen + better speed/transparency curves
v1.1.1: things get harder much more quickly
v1.1.2: the canvas fits the screen again
v2.0: there's now a score mechanism, as well as a lose mechanism. Also instructions.
v2.1: still hard, but slightly less so
v2.2: instead of adding a dot every 3 revivals, it's every 5.
v2.3: you can now restart after losing
v2.3.1: the white dot has a lower top speed now, and takes longer to get there.
v2.3.2: clarified the instructions.
v2.3.3: clarified 'em some more
v2.3.4: made it so you have to press spacebar instead of any key to start/restart the game. This way you can screenshot without it restarting.

v2.5.3: more bugfixes
v2.6.0: balls now change speed and lifetimes as you regenerate them
