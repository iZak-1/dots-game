v1.0.2: the website now includes the canvas, instead of being blank
v1.1: the canvas changes to fit the screen + better speed/transparency curves
v1.1.1: things get harder much more quickly
v1.1.2: the canvas fits the screen again
v2.0: there's now a score mechanism, as well as a lose mechanism. Also instructions.

v2.2: instead of adding a dot every 3 revivals, it's every 5.
