			<size=+3><center>Instructions: the dots will move accross the screen. As they do so, they will start to die. As they begin to die, they will grow slower and more transparent. Once they die, they will become red "X"s. To revive one, you must click it. You can't revive a dot when the white dot (which follows your mouse around) is over it. As time goes by, the white dot gets faster and more small dots spawn in.</center></size><br><br><br>
